# Epistemic Me

**A Philosophical Toolkit for Building AI Models of Self**

## About Us

Epistemic Me provides developers with tools and frameworks for building AI models that can understand and predict human belief systems and behaviors. Our platform bridges philosophical epistemology with artificial intelligence to create more meaningful and context-aware AI applications.

## Our Projects

### Core Infrastructure

#### üñ•Ô∏è Server

gRPC API server for belief system management and AI model integration.

- [Server](https://github.com/Epistemic-Me/Server)
- Belief system operations
- Dialectic processing
- Predictive processing framework

#### üì± Apps

Reference implementations and demonstration applications.

- [Apps](https://github.com/Epistemic-Me/Apps)
- Self-model visualizations
- Belief system interactions
- Dialectic interfaces

#### üîÑ Protocol Buffers

Service definitions for belief system and dialectic operations.

- [Proto](https://github.com/Epistemic-Me/Proto)
- Standardized message formats
- Service interfaces
- Cross-platform compatibility

### Epistemic "Plug-ins"

Opening the door to any contributor who has a philosophy of how to enact change.

- [Philosophies](https://github.com/Epistemic-Me/Philosophies/tree/main) that enable anyone to write a "plug-in" to Epistemic Me. This includes philosophers, scientists, helath practioners, and more.
- Use CLI to generate Philosophies based off of past work like Blogs, Podcasts, etc.

## Key Features

- üß† **Predictive Processing**: Build models that can predict agent behavior and choices
- üîÑ **Belief Systems**: Model individual and collective belief systems
- ü§ñ **AI Integration**: Complement generative AI with philosophical frameworks
- üìä **Error Correction**: Self vs world models with built-in error correction
- üéØ **Philosophical Framework**: Utilize various philosophical paradigms for learning

## Getting Started

1. **Explore Our Philosophy**:
   - Read our [Introduction](https://github.com/Epistemic-Me/Docs/introduction.mdx)
   - Understand our [Core Concepts](https://github.com/Epistemic-Me/Docs/concepts/overview.mdx)

2. **Choose Your SDK**:
