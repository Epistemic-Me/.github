# Epistemic Me

**A Philosophical Toolkit for Building AI Models of Self**

## About Us

Epistemic Me provides developers with tools and frameworks for building AI models that can understand and predict human belief systems and behaviors. Our platform bridges philosophical epistemology with artificial intelligence to create more meaningful and context-aware AI applications.
